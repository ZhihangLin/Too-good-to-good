# Too-good-to-good
Our idea was that we wanted to create a website where people could make secret boxes of things they didn't need!


To run our project:
1.copy SSH key from Main branch

2.clone project using SSH key in terminal or just download the zip files

3.open terminal and cd to too-good-to-good folder, then type firebase init in terminal

4.open too-good-to-good folder in VS code
type these command in VS code terminal: 
 ```bash
npm install @mui/icons-material @mui/material @emotion/styled @emotion/react
npm install react-router-dom@5
npm install react-currency-format --force
npm install react-scripts --save-dev --force
```
